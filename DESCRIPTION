Description: Urinator allows visualizations of cage humidity data acquired 
through Techniplast's Digital Ventilated Cage system. It is based on the 
assumption that humidity will normally arise from urination. As increased 
urination is a symptom if diabetes, large increases in cage humidity suggests
hyperglycemia and diabetes. The program takes 1. a  recording file and 2. 
an event file in csv format, and generates individual- and grouped data, 
allowing users to identify cages containing animals with diabetes.
